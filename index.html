    <h3>6/23/21 - Post #1: </h3>
    <p>This is my first post to this website. I'm currently working on learning git commands for an internship. I'm not gonna lie it's pretty
      difficult. I also know for a fact that this is not a good way to post things to my website but c'est la vie. I think I got down copying a
      repository to VS Code using the mac terminal and I can add, commit, push, and pull files. I know the commands for rebasing, merging, 
      making branches and checking out branches but it's pretty hard to understand. I'm having some trouble making the manuel edits to conflicting
      code when I merge or rebase but I'll work on that. Aside from learning git stuff I'm working on learning python better and understanding the 
      libraries like matplotlip and numpy. Also what the hell is conda???? I downloaded it but I don't really understand what it does. I guess
      I'll just keep watching YouTube Videos and see if I can get it down. P.S. I wrote this whole thing in a separate branch so that kinda messed me up
      guess I got more work to do learning how branches work.
