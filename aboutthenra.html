        <p>THE NRA (THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION) IS A BUISSNESS FED BY THE IGNORANCE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THEY SPREAD THEIR IDEAS FASTER THEN THE SPREAD THEIR GUNS. THEY TELL AMERICANS THAT THEIR FREEDOM AND LIBERTY ARE CONNECTED TO THEIR GUNS. THE NRA IS TRYING TO MAKE TAKING AWAY GUNS LIKE TAKING AWAY THEIR FREEDOM AND LIBERTY.<br></p>

        <p><br> IT MAY SEEM LIKE THE NRA WOULD BE LOSING MONEY BECAUSE OF THE RECENT SHOOTINGS, BUT IT'S THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE! THE NRA IS TELLING THEIR MEMBERS TWO THINGS: THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS OUT TO TAKE THEIR FIREARMS, SO THEY'D BETTER STOCK UP, AND THAT THE ONLY WAY TO PROTECT YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY FROM THESE SHOOTERS IS WITH GUNS. </p>
